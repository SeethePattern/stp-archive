But there's a problem. These filaments appear at vastly different scales, yet they share strikingly similar properties: consistent width, coherence, and resilience. Standard cosmology struggles to explain them. Gravity alone shouldn't produce such thread-like structures, especially not ones that persist even as stars form along their length. And at the largest scales, theorists invoke invisible scaffolds of dark matter to hold the plasma in place, despite no direct observational evidence.

In this episode, we dive deep into one of the most misunderstood aspects of quantum mechanics — superposition, collapse, and spin entanglement — and reveal how the standard narrative may be more about interpretation than observation. What if the “weirdness” of quantum mechanics is actually a misunderstanding of analog behavior forced into a digital framework?

We revisit the famous photon polarizer experiments, the logic behind Malus’ Law, and the foundational assumptions of Bell’s Theorem. Along the way, we explore how field interactions and geometric coupling can reproduce the same experimental outcomes — without invoking metaphysical collapse or non-local effects.

This video challenges the idea that spin must be undefined until measurement, and instead offers a grounded alternative: that spin, like polarization, may be a real, structured interaction with the field — not a binary mystery collapsing into being.
