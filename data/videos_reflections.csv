REF-20260124-long,How Language Simplifies Experience and the Hidden Cost for Science,https://youtu.be/tOBAIFhZwvU,2026-01-24,Reflection; Philosophy,"We usually think of language as a neutral tool, something we use after we observe the world.
But what if language arrives first?

In this reflection, I explore how the same mental process that helps us navigate everyday experience, by simplifying, categorising, and labelling, quietly reshapes how science itself works.

Labels reduce cognitive load.
They help us make sense of complexity.
But when those labels harden into assumptions, models can stop describing reality and start defining what reality is allowed to be.

This pattern appears everywhere.
In how identity forms.
In how scientific frameworks take hold.
And in how concepts like dark matter, expansion, or wavefunction collapse move from tools of interpretation to unquestioned structure.

This is not about conspiracy or bad science.
It is about a deeply human mechanism, the same one that makes a cup instantly become a cup, and what happens when that mechanism governs how we interpret the universe.

This is a reflection on language, models, and the invisible boundaries they create in science.

REF-20260104-long,The Questions We No Longer Ask,https://youtu.be/ZNA8Hzr0tyo,2026-01-04,Reflection; Philosophy,"Why does inertia exist?
Where do physical constants come from?
Why are some questions treated as unnecessary rather than unanswered?

This reflection isn’t about rejecting modern physics — it’s about remembering what used to drive it.

At some point, certain foundational questions quietly disappeared from mainstream discussion. Not because they were resolved, but because we were told they no longer needed to be asked.

Cosmic Relativity enters this conversation not as a final answer, but as a reminder — a doorway that reopens curiosity and allows us to ask “why” again, without apology.

This is a reflection on curiosity, permission, and the cultural shift that taught us to stop asking the most basic questions about the world we inhabit.

Not to argue.
Not to convince.
But to notice what we may have lost along the way.",,,,,,,20251221-long

REF-20251223-long,How We Lost Our Way of Thinking,https://youtu.be/IxmeXdg4gWk,2025-12-23,Reflection; Philosophy,"At some point, something shifted.

Not all at once.
Not loudly.
But gradually enough that we barely noticed it happening.

This isn’t a video about blaming technology, politics, or any one idea.
It’s a reflection on something more subtle.  How layers of abstraction, models, systems, and narratives slowly replaced our direct relationship with the world itself.

How tools meant to help us understand reality quietly became more important than reality.

This is not an argument, and it’s not a diagnosis.
It’s a pause.

A moment to step back and look at how we got here and why so many things now feel strangely disconnected, confusing, or out of alignment.

If you’ve ever felt that something fundamental has drifted, but struggled to put your finger on what, this reflection is for you.",,,,,,,
